## Why ESP32?
ESP32 are wireless microcontrollers produced by espressif, they have big community and offer simple development using esp-idf libraries.

## Which ESP32?
C series offers all the functionality we need and in addition it has two cores and modules have included up to 8MB of flash. Since price difference in C series is very small we decided to go with most powerfull one ESP32-C6.

### ESP32-C6 module
ESP32-C6 is only the chip but espressif also develops modules which contain all the necessary circutitry for anthena and chip itself also it contains additional flash memory. For easier assembly we chose ESP32-C6-WROOM1U-N8 with mini coaxial connector for antenna and with 8 MB flash module.
